## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Page shows 404**
**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub Settings → Pages is enabled on `gh-pages` branch
2. Wait 5 minutes and refresh
3. Clear browser cache

### **Issue: CSS/JS not loading**
**Solution:**
1. Verify `package.json` homepage URL matches your GitHub username
2. Run `npm run deploy` again

### **Issue: Routes show 404 (e.g., /profile)**
**Solution:**
- GitHub Pages doesn't support SPA routing perfectly
- Users should navigate using the app's internal links

```bash
# Clear cache and redeploy
rm -rf dist
npm run deploy
```
